Examples
========
This directory contains examples of the different modules in perses that can are used expanded
ensemble simulations using various methods.

Subdirectories
--------------
The examples are organized in subdirectories as follows. More information on each example in the `README` files inside
each subdirectory.

* [`atom-mapping`](atom-mapping) - Notebooks and script with examples on how to use perses atom mapping capabilities.
* [`barnase-barstar-neq-switching`](barnase-barstar-neq-switching) - FE estimate using NEQ switching in protein:protein barnase-barnase complex.
* [`dipeptide-neq-switching`](dipeptide-neq-switching) - Alanine dipeptide mutation using NEQ switching.
* [`kinase-neq-switching`](kinase-neq-switching) - NTKR1 kinase protein-ligand FE simulation using NEQ cycling
* [`moonshot-mainseries`](moonshot-mainseries) - Scripts used to prepare simulations to run with perses CLI for the COVID Moonshot
* [`protein-ligand-repex`](protein-ligand-repex) - Tyk2 protein-ligand benchmark Replica Exchange simulation examples, using both perses CLI and its pythonic API.
